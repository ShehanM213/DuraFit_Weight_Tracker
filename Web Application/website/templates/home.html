  <h5>Note</h5>
  <h6>The BMI Scale is not accurate all the time. Sometimes your result could be shown as overweight or underweight eventhough you are not.
    We recommend you to follow a healthy diet plan and exercise regularly to maintain your fitness. </h6>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <h5>Ask yourself these questions about any diet plan you're considering</h5>
  <h6>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Does it include various foods from the major food groups: fruits, vegetables, grains, low-fat dairy products, lean protein sources and nuts?<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Does it include foods you like and that you would enjoy eating for a lifetime â€” not just for several weeks or months?<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Can you easily find these foods in your local grocery store?<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Will you be able to eat your favorite foods or, better yet, all foods (even if some are in small quantities)?<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Does it fit your lifestyle and budget?<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Does it include proper amounts of nutrients and calories to help you lose weight safely and effectively?<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Is regular physical activity part of the plan?<br/>
